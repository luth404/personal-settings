# My Custom Settings

I needed to save all my custom settings in one place, and I realized that I could save them in this repository and also share them with others. So if you want to know how I configure some of my apps, like VS Code, feel free to check it out.

In this repository you will find:

- VS Code User Settings
- zhrc settings
